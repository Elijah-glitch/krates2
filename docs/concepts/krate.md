# Krate

A Krate is an abstract notion used to organize collections and acts as a namespace for data storage.

Everything stored inside a Krate can be uniquely identified by its **Record ID** or its **Collection ID.**

## Properties

- [!badge size="xl" text="Krate ID"]

  A Krate ID should always be a 20 character alpha-numeric string.
